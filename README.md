## Simple CRUD app (RS School task)

### technical requirements

- Use 18 LTS version of Node.js

### installation process

- Clone this repo (git clone https://github.com/top-aleksei/crud-api.git)
- Open repository folder in terminal code code editor. (make sure you are in 'CRUD-API' folder)
- Switch to develop branch (git checkout develop)
- Install dependencies (npm install)

### run application

-you can run application in 'development' mode(npm run start:dev) or in 'product' mode (npm run start:prod)

## Implementation details

1. Implemented endpoint `api/users`:
   - **GET** `api/users` is used to get all persons
     - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and all users records
   - **GET** `api/users/{userId}`
     - Server should answer with `status code` **200** and record with `id === userId` if it exists
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
   - **POST** `api/users` is used to create record about new user and store it in database
     - Server should answer with `status code` **201** and newly created record
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if request `body` does not contain **required** fields
   - **PUT** `api/users/{userId}` is used to update existing user
     - Server should answer with` status code` **200** and updated record
     - Server should answer with` status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with` status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
   - **DELETE** `api/users/{userId}` is used to delete existing user from database
     - Server should answer with `status code` **204** if the record is found and deleted
     - Server should answer with `status code` **400** and corresponding message if `userId` is invalid (not `uuid`)
     - Server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding message if record with `id === userId` doesn't exist
2. Users are stored as `objects` that have following properties:
   - `id` — unique identifier (`string`, `uuid`) generated on server side
   - `username` — user's name (`string`, **required**)
   - `age` — user's age (`number`, **required**)
   - `hobbies` — user's hobbies (`array` of `strings` or empty `array`, **required**)
3. Requests to non-existing endpoints (e.g. `some-non/existing/resource`) should be handled (server should answer with `status code` **404** and corresponding human-friendly message)
4. Errors on the server side that occur during the processing of a request should be handled and processed correctly (server should answer with `status code` **500** and corresponding human-friendly message)
5. Value of `port` on which application is running should be stored in `.env` file
6. There should be 2 modes of running application (**development** and **production**):
   - The application is run in development mode using `nodemon` (there is a `npm` script `start:dev`)
   - The application is run in production mode (there is a `npm` script `start:prod` that starts the build process and then runs the bundled file)
